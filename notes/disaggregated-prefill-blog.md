# Disaggregated Prefill: Splitting the Inference Pipeline in NanoGPT

Every LLM inference request goes through two fundamentally different computational phases. The first — **prefill** — ingests the entire prompt in a single dense forward pass, saturating FLOPs with high arithmetic intensity. The second — **decode** — generates tokens one at a time, fetching the entire KV cache from memory for each new token. Prefill is compute-bound. Decode is memory-bandwidth-bound.

In a monolithic inference engine, these two phases share the same device, the same thread, and the same scheduler step. While prefill is crunching through a long prompt, decode requests sit idle. While decode is streaming one-token-at-a-time, the GPU's compute units are underutilized. They interfere with each other because they have entirely different hardware profiles competing for the same resources.

**Disaggregated prefill** eliminates this interference by splitting prefill and decode into separate workers. In production systems like vLLM's P/D disaggregation and DeepSeek's architecture, these workers run on separate GPU instances. I wanted to understand this pattern from first principles, so I implemented it in my NanoGPT inference engine using Python threads and a KV cache handoff protocol.

## The Architecture

The design splits the engine into three components connected by thread-safe queues:

```
                     ┌─────────────────────────┐
   incoming ───────►│    PREFILL WORKER         │
   requests          │  (Thread 1)               │
                     │  • Runs full prefill pass  │
                     │  • Produces KV cache       │
                     │  • Samples first token     │
                     └──────────┬──────────────┘
                                │
                         KV cache handoff
                       (KVTransfer via Queue)
                                │
                     ┌──────────▼──────────────┐
                     │    DECODE WORKER          │
                     │  (Thread 2)               │
                     │  • Receives pre-filled KV  │
                     │  • Runs batched decode     │
                     │  • Produces output tokens  │
                     └──────────┬──────────────┘
                                │
                         completed requests
                                │
                     ┌──────────▼──────────────┐
                     │    COORDINATOR            │
                     │  (Main thread)            │
                     │  • Feeds request_queue     │
                     │  • Collects results        │
                     └───────────────────────────┘
```

Both workers share the **same model object**. This works because PyTorch releases the GIL during tensor operations, the model weights are read-only in `eval()` mode, and each thread creates its own intermediate tensors. In production, each worker would have its own GPU and model replica — the shared-model approach simulates the same architectural boundary without requiring multiple devices.

---

## The KV Transfer Protocol

The critical design problem is: how does the prefill worker hand off state to the decode worker? I defined a `KVTransfer` dataclass as the contract between them:

```python
@dataclass
class KVTransfer:
    """Payload sent from prefill worker to decode worker."""
    request_id: int
    prompt_tokens: List[int]
    max_new_tokens: int
    kv_cache: Dict[Tuple[int, int], Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]]
    first_token_id: int          # the token sampled at the end of prefill
    prefill_time_ms: float       # for latency tracking
```

The KV cache is a dictionary keyed by `(layer_index, head_index)`, with each value being a `(key_tensor, value_tensor)` pair. The prefill worker clones these tensors before putting them on the queue — in a real multi-GPU system, this clone would be a network transfer (NCCL, RDMA), but the semantic boundary is the same. The decode worker should not assume it can reach into the prefill worker's memory.

Including `first_token_id` in the transfer is a subtle but important detail. The prefill worker doesn't just compute the KV cache — it also samples the first output token from the last-position logits. This means the decode worker can immediately begin generating from the *second* token, with the request already carrying one generated token.

---

## The Prefill Worker

The prefill worker is the simpler of the two — a tight loop that pulls requests from a queue and runs a full forward pass:

```python
def prefill_worker(model, request_queue, kv_transfer_queue, stop_event):
    model.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        while not stop_event.is_set():
            try:
                request = request_queue.get(timeout=0.05)
            except queue.Empty:
                continue

            t0 = time.perf_counter()
            prompt = torch.tensor([request.prompt_tokens], device=device)
            logits, _, new_kvs = model(prompt)

            # Build per-(layer, head) KV cache
            kv_cache = {}
            for li, bkv in enumerate(new_kvs):
                for hi, (k, v) in enumerate(bkv):
                    kv_cache[(li, hi)] = (k.clone(), v.clone())

            # Sample first token
            logits = logits[:, -1, :]
            probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=-1)
            first_token = torch.multinomial(probs, num_samples=1)

            prefill_ms = (time.perf_counter() - t0) * 1000
            transfer = KVTransfer(
                request_id=request.id,
                prompt_tokens=request.prompt_tokens,
                max_new_tokens=request.max_new_tokens,
                kv_cache=kv_cache,
                first_token_id=first_token.item(),
                prefill_time_ms=prefill_ms,
            )
            kv_transfer_queue.put(transfer)
```

One key difference from the monolithic scheduler: there's **no chunking**. The prefill worker processes the entire prompt in a single forward pass because it doesn't share a token budget with decode. It can saturate its compute without throttling to leave room for decode tokens. This is one of the fundamental benefits of disaggregation.

---

## The Decode Worker

The decode worker is a continuous batching loop — structurally almost identical to the monolithic scheduler's decode path, but sourcing pre-filled requests from the transfer queue instead of doing prefill itself:

```python
def decode_worker(model, kv_transfer_queue, results_queue, stop_event,
                  max_batch_size=4):
    model.eval()
    active_requests = []

    with torch.no_grad():
        step = 0
        while not stop_event.is_set() or active_requests:
            # Drain the transfer queue — admit new pre-filled requests
            while not kv_transfer_queue.empty() and len(active_requests) < max_batch_size:
                transfer = kv_transfer_queue.get()
                req = Request(
                    id=transfer.request_id,
                    prompt_tokens=transfer.prompt_tokens,
                    max_new_tokens=transfer.max_new_tokens,
                    kv_cache=transfer.kv_cache,
                    status="active",
                )
                req.generated_tokens.append(transfer.first_token_id)
                req._last_token = torch.tensor(
                    [[transfer.first_token_id]], device=device
                )
                req.prefill_cursor = len(req.prompt_tokens)
                active_requests.append(req)

            if not active_requests:
                time.sleep(0.01)
                continue

            # Standard batched decode
            batch_tokens = torch.cat([r._last_token for r in active_requests])
            batch_positions = torch.tensor(
                [[len(r.tokens_so_far) - 1] for r in active_requests],
                device=device,
            )
            past_kvs, attn_mask, pad_lengths = assemble_batch_cache(active_requests)
            logits, _, new_kvs = model(
                batch_tokens, pos=batch_positions,
                past_kvs=past_kvs, attn_mask=attn_mask,
            )

            logits = logits[:, -1, :]
            probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=-1)
            idx_next = torch.multinomial(probs, num_samples=1)
            disassemble_batch_cache(active_requests, new_kvs, pad_lengths)

            for i, req in enumerate(active_requests):
                req.generated_tokens.append(idx_next[i].item())
                req._last_token = idx_next[i:i + 1]

            # Retire completed requests
            still_active = []
            for req in active_requests:
                if req.is_done:
                    results_queue.put(req)
                else:
                    still_active.append(req)
            active_requests = still_active
```

The decode worker **never runs a prefill forward pass**. It only performs the memory-bandwidth-bound single-token decode, using `assemble_batch_cache()` and `disassemble_batch_cache()` for left-padded batching across requests with different sequence lengths.

The critical behavioral difference becomes visible in the telemetry logs. Where a monolithic scheduler alternates between prefill and decode within a single step:

```
step 0: prefill req0 (30 tokens), decode batch=0
step 1: prefill req0 (continued), decode batch=0
step 2: decode batch=1 (req0)
step 3: prefill req1, decode batch=1 (req0)    ← req0's decode blocked by req1's prefill
```

The disaggregated version shows the two phases running asynchronously:

```
[PREFILL] req 0: 30 tokens → KV transfer (2.3ms)
[PREFILL] req 1: 15 tokens → KV transfer (1.1ms)
[DECODE]  step 0: batch=1 (req0)
[DECODE]  step 1: batch=2 (req0, req1)          ← decode never blocked by prefill
[PREFILL] req 2: 20 tokens → KV transfer (1.5ms)
[DECODE]  step 2: batch=2 (req0, req1)
[DECODE]  step 3: batch=3 (req0, req1, req2)
```

Prefill doesn't block decode. Decode doesn't wait for prefill. The decode batch grows smoothly as pre-filled requests arrive.

---

## The Coordinator

The main thread ties everything together — create the workers, feed requests, collect results:

```python
def disaggregated_generate(model, requests, max_batch_size=4):
    request_queue = queue.Queue()       # main → prefill worker
    kv_transfer_queue = queue.Queue()   # prefill → decode worker
    results_queue = queue.Queue()       # decode → main
    stop_event = threading.Event()

    prefill_thread = threading.Thread(
        target=prefill_worker,
        args=(model, request_queue, kv_transfer_queue, stop_event),
        daemon=True,
    )
    decode_thread = threading.Thread(
        target=decode_worker,
        args=(model, kv_transfer_queue, results_queue, stop_event, max_batch_size),
        daemon=True,
    )

    prefill_thread.start()
    decode_thread.start()

    for req in requests:
        request_queue.put(req)

    completed = 0
    while completed < len(requests):
        try:
            req = results_queue.get(timeout=0.5)
            completed += 1
        except queue.Empty:
            continue

    stop_event.set()
    prefill_thread.join()
    decode_thread.join()
    return requests
```

The `stop_event` provides clean shutdown: the prefill worker exits its loop, and the decode worker finishes draining its active requests before terminating. No deadlocks, no orphaned threads.

## Benchmark Results

To validate the architecture, I built a benchmark suite that compares the disaggregated engine against the monolithic chunked-prefill scheduler across six workload scenarios. Each scenario runs the same requests through both engines and measures wall time, throughput (gen tokens/s), time-to-first-token (TTFT), and average request latency.

Here are the headline numbers:

### Smoke Test (4 requests, 16-token prompts, 8 new tokens)

| Method | Wall (s) | Gen tok/s | Avg TTFT (ms) | Avg Latency (ms) |
|--------|----------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Monolithic | 0.036 | 894 | 11.32 | 30.34 |
| Disaggregated | 0.060 | 534 | 10.11 | 29.01 |

At this trivially small scale, disaggregation is **slower** (0.60x throughput). The threading overhead — queue puts/gets, thread synchronization, `time.sleep()` polls — dominates when there are only 4 requests with 16-token prompts. This is expected and important to acknowledge.

### Staggered Arrivals (8 requests, 24-token prompts, 10 new tokens)

| Method | Wall (s) | Gen tok/s | Avg TTFT (ms) | Avg Latency (ms) |
|--------|----------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Monolithic | 0.103 | 775 | 49.68 | 81.97 |
| Disaggregated | 0.073 | 1103 | 23.17 | 46.37 |

Here the benefit materializes: **1.42x throughput**, **53% lower TTFT**, **43% lower latency**. With 8 staggered requests, the monolithic scheduler's head-of-line blocking becomes significant — later requests queue behind earlier prefills. The disaggregated engine processes prefills in parallel with ongoing decodes.

### Long Prompts (6 requests, 40-token prompts, 8 new tokens)

| Method | Wall (s) | Gen tok/s | Avg TTFT (ms) | Avg Latency (ms) |
|--------|----------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Monolithic | 0.108 | 443 | 64.22 | 96.99 |
| Disaggregated | 0.067 | 716 | 16.61 | 34.38 |

This is the **strongest result**: **1.62x throughput** and a **74% reduction in TTFT**. Long prompts amplify the prefill/decode interference because the monolithic scheduler must chunk the 40-token prompt across multiple steps, blocking decode during each prefill chunk. The disaggregated engine processes the full prompt in one shot on the prefill worker while the decode worker continues uninterrupted.

### Long Decode (6 requests, 16-token prompts, 32 new tokens)

| Method | Wall (s) | Gen tok/s | Avg TTFT (ms) | Avg Latency (ms) |
|--------|----------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Monolithic | 0.187 | 1029 | 60.87 | 144.41 |
| Disaggregated | 0.165 | 1164 | 33.47 | 98.77 |

Moderate gains: **1.13x throughput**, **45% lower TTFT**. When decode dominates (32 new tokens per request), the decode worker is the bottleneck regardless of architecture. But TTFT still improves because requests enter the decode phase faster.

### Stress Test (16 requests, 16-token prompts, 10 new tokens)

| Method | Wall (s) | Gen tok/s | Avg TTFT (ms) | Avg Latency (ms) |
|--------|----------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Monolithic | 0.156 | 1025 | 72.62 | 101.51 |
| Disaggregated | 0.150 | 1069 | 52.81 | 77.22 |

At scale: **1.04x throughput**, **27% lower TTFT**, **24% lower latency**. With 16 requests competing for a batch size of 4, both engines are admission-constrained. The disaggregated version still wins on latency because the prefill pipeline never blocks the decode pipeline.

### Batch Pressure (12 requests, 16-token prompts, batch size 2)

| Method | Wall (s) | Gen tok/s | Avg TTFT (ms) | Avg Latency (ms) |
|--------|----------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Monolithic | 0.133 | 721 | 63.96 | 80.52 |
| Disaggregated | 0.136 | 706 | 53.38 | 68.47 |

Near-parity throughput (0.98x) but still **17% lower TTFT** and **15% lower latency**. Even under tight batch constraints, disaggregation helps latency.

---

## Summary of Results

| Scenario | Throughput Ratio | TTFT Ratio | Latency Ratio |
|----------|:---------------:|:----------:|:-------------:|
| smoke_test | 0.60x | 0.89x | 0.96x |
| staggered_arrivals | **1.42x** | **0.47x** | **0.57x** |
| batch_pressure | 0.98x | 0.83x | 0.85x |
| long_prompts | **1.62x** | **0.26x** | **0.35x** |
| long_decode | 1.13x | 0.55x | 0.68x |
| stress_test | 1.04x | 0.73x | 0.76x |

*(Ratios < 1.0 for TTFT/latency = disaggregated is better)*

The pattern is clear: **disaggregation shines when prefill is expensive relative to decode**. The `long_prompts` scenario — where 40-token prompts would require multiple chunked-prefill steps in the monolithic scheduler — shows a 74% TTFT reduction. The `smoke_test` scenario — where prompts are tiny and the overhead of threading dominates — shows disaggregation is slightly worse.

This matches the production intuition perfectly. vLLM and DeepSeek deploy disaggregated prefill on workloads with long context windows (32K+ tokens), where a single prefill can occupy a GPU for hundreds of milliseconds. On those workloads, the latency-sensitive decode requests absolutely cannot afford to be blocked behind prefill.

---

## A Note on Token Mismatches

The benchmark logs show `⚠ Req N: token mismatch (expected with different RNG consumption)` for every request. This might look alarming, but it's expected and well-understood.

The monolithic and disaggregated engines consume PyTorch's random number generator in different orders. In the monolithic scheduler, prefill and decode interleave within a single thread, consuming RNG values in a deterministic but interleaved order. In the disaggregated version, the prefill and decode workers are in separate threads — the prefill worker might consume RNG for request 2's sampling before or after the decode worker consumes RNG for request 0's next token, depending on thread scheduling.

Since the RNG sequences diverge after the first sample, the generated tokens are different — but both are valid samples from the model's distribution. The architectural pattern is correct; the tokens are just drawn from different points in the RNG stream. To verify true equivalence, you'd need to use either greedy decoding or per-request `torch.Generator` instances, which is a worthwhile extension but not necessary for validating the disaggregation pattern.

---

## Connection to Production Systems

| This Implementation | Production (vLLM P/D) |
|----|-----|
| `threading.Thread` | Separate GPU processes |
| `queue.Queue` | NCCL / RDMA / TCP KV transfer |
| Shared `model` object | Separate model replicas per GPU |
| `KVTransfer` dataclass | KV cache transfer protocol (tensor metadata + data) |
| `clone()` KV tensors | GPU-to-GPU memory copy |
| Single-machine overlap | Multi-node pipeline parallelism |

The architectural pattern is identical — the only difference is what the "boundary" between prefill and decode actually is. In this implementation, it's a Python `queue.Queue`. In production, it's a network link carrying serialized KV tensors between machines. The `KVTransfer` dataclass maps directly to the wire protocol.

What this educational implementation *doesn't* capture is the memory management complexity of production disaggregation: KV cache pooling, tensor parallelism across the transfer, page-aligned block transfers, and the scheduling logic for balancing prefill and decode worker utilization. But the fundamental insight — that splitting these two fundamentally different computational phases into independent workers eliminates head-of-line blocking and improves tail latency — comes through clearly even at NanoGPT scale.

---

## Key Takeaway

The model doesn't know anything about disaggregation. `model.forward()` is called identically whether it's running prefill or decode — it's just called from different threads with different inputs. All of the disaggregation complexity lives in the threading and queue orchestration above the model. The Transformer blocks, attention heads, `assemble_batch_cache()`, `disassemble_batch_cache()` — none of it changes.

This is the elegant part: disaggregated prefill is a **pure scheduling optimization**. It's not a model architecture change, not a kernel optimization, not a memory management change. It's recognizing that prefill and decode have different computational profiles and giving them separate execution contexts so they don't interfere with each other.
